History of Anabot
=================

Anabot was originally created for testing of interactive GUI RHEL-7 installator
- Anaconda. Soon after initial support of anaconda was done in anabot, it was
extended to support initial-setup (still Anaconda code base), and later some
support for subscription-manager-gui was added. Currently (March 2017), there
is effort to use anabot also for TUI interface of anaconda.
